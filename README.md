# Tempocute
 
 This project shows the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit when you clap twice. It runs on A4 batteries and changes display color as a function of the light in the room. In was written for an Arduino and a pic is available on my website. I also didn't have the driver for the led matrix so I had to add a lot of repetitive code to display the numbers.
